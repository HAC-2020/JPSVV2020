OUR TEAM PROJECT NAME IS CV-19 HELPING TOOL.CV-19 HELPING TOOL IS A TYPE OF APPLICATION.WE HAVE CREATED AN APP PROTOTYPE TO PRESENT OUR IDEA TO THE JUDGES.

PROBLEM:AS CORONAVIRUS SUFFERERS ARE INCREASING DAY BY DAY,IN HOSPITALS,THE COVID-19 STAFF ARE NOT AVAILABLE 24/7 HOURS TO INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS,THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TESTED POSITIVE AND HAVE BEEN QUARANTINED FOR SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD.THERE ARE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS FACED BY THE PATIENTS AND THEY NEED URGENT HELP 
        FROM THE DOCTORS OR NURSES AT ANY TIME.EVEN,STAFF MEMBERS INTERACT WITH THE COVID-19 PATIENTS WHEN THEY GO TO THE WARDS TO DELIVER THEIR FOOD.


SOLUTION:WE HAVE BUILT-UP A SOFTWARE APPLICATION WHEREIN WE PROVIDE THE FACILITY TO THE PATIENTS TO ORDER THEIR FOOD AND MESSAGE IN CASE OF EMERGENCY THROUGH THE APP TO THE MEDICAL STAFF.SO,WHEN THE PATIENTS ORDER THE FOOD WITHIN THE TIMINGS MENTIONED,THE STAFF ALLOTED TO THAT WARD WOULD RECEIVE A MESSAGE AND THE STAFF WOULD 
         BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR REQUIREMENTS AND STAFF WOULD KEEP THE FOOD OUTSIDE THE WARD OF THAT PATIENT AND THE PATIENT NEED TO CHECK OUTSIDE AFTER 15 MINUTES OF ORDERING. PRACTISING THIS,THE STAFF AND PATIENTS WOULD COME IN LESS CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER AND STAFF MEMBERS WOULD HAVE LESSER CHANCE OF SUFFERING FROM CORONA.THE SAME WOULD BE 
         APPLIED TO THE EMERGENCY NEEDS OF THE PATIENTS.THE STAFF WOULD RECEIVE MESSAGE THROUGH THE APP AND THEY CAN REACH QUICKLY TO THE PATIENT IN NEED.
